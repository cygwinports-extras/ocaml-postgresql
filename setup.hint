ldesc: "This OCaml-library provides an interface to PostgreSQL, an 
efficient and reliable, open source, relational database. Almost all 
functionality available through the C-API (libpq) is replicated in a 
type-safe way. This library uses objects for representing database 
connections and results of queries."
